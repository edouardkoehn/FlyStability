# ðŸª°  Fly Stability  ðŸª°
This repository contains all the code related to the Fly Stability project. This project was part of my master thesis conducted in the [Neural Systems and Machine Learning Lab](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/) under the supervision of K. Bouchard.

The goal of this project was to answer the following questions:
- How does the stability of an RNN influence the emegence of functional dynamic?
-Is stability a sufficient or necessary condition for functionnla dynamic to develop?
